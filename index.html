                <p class="aboutMeP">Hi. I am Carlos Martinez.  Creator of  HelloWebs. 
                    I founded this business to help meatspace business owners who are 
                    thinking of transitioning their business into the cyber world.  I am a solo, but committed, self-taught web developer/designer with hundreds and hundred lines of code,  a few too many error lines , and 3000+ cups of coffee.  I am a  full-time dad, part-time
                     geek with a  8-5 job. did I mention that I’m often easily distracted?</p>
                     <p class="aboutMeP">I started my own business because I wanted to work with people I wanted to be friends with, because I wanted to put relationships before sales. The thing about real relationships is that we have to be willing
                          to be vulnerable and say what’s really on our minds and in our hearts.</p>
                          <p class="aboutMeP">I am unique, I’m not like other web designers,  who just stamp out a new website after another using a generic template, without taking the time to understand your vision. I care deeply about the results I deliver. I insist on getting to know you and your business almost as 
                              well as you do so that I can create a website that feels like you and brings you more online clients. </p>
